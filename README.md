These charts offer a clear and concise view of salary distributions and trends across different segments of the workforce, providing valuable insights into employee compensation structures.

This project demonstrates the effective use of Excelâ€™s pivot tables and charting tools for data analysis and visualization, making it a practical example for those interested in exploring employee data or enhancing their Excel skills.
